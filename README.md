# 5016Project2021

In the recent century, the development of deep learning brings us to handle computer vision tasks from impossible-to-be-done to possible-to-be-done. This revolution to computer vision is attributed from the advancement of deep learning by which the learning model is getting complex enough to resolve many problems from image classification, Captioning, Object Detection, Object Tracking, Style Transfer, Image Translation, Deep Dream and Semantic Segmentation. Several deep learning architectures have been explored for solving image classification, object detection, object tracking and activity recognition challenges which are widely adopted in the real world.

In this paper, we will discuss four deep learning models’ from the level of heavy training effort to no training effort (ready to use library). 
From below we address 4 examples of different deep learning approaches 

1. Face Mask Detection and Object Detection
2. DCGAN
3. Face Recognition by VGG16 Transfer Learning
4. Face Detector by Dlib

In addition, we will discuss the migration of these four applications to a web platform by tensorflow.js.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
