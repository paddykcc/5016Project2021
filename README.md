ABSTRACT
In the recent century, the development of deep learning brings us to handle computer vision tasks from impossible-to-be-done to possible-to-be-done. This revolution to computer vision is attributed from the advancement of deep learning by which the learning model is getting complex enough to resolve many problems from image classification, Captioning, Object Detection, Object Tracking, Style Transfer, Image Translation, Deep Dream and Semantic Segmentation. Several deep learning architectures have been explored for solving image classification, object detection, object tracking and activity recognition challenges which are widely adopted in the real world.

In this paper, we will discuss four deep learning modelsâ€™ from the level of heavy training effort to no training effort (ready to use library). 
From below we address 4 examples of different deep learning approaches 

1. Face Mask Detection and Object Detection
2. DCGAN
3. Face Recognition by VGG16 Transfer Learning
4. Face Detector by Dlib

Each of these four examples will be analyzed and explained in below sections. In addition, we will discuss the migration of these four applications to a web platform by tensorflow.js.
